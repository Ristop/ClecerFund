Aug 16 2016 -
	1.1 Generated controller for notice
	1.2 set up a super basic page template
	1.3 Tried to get Gmail API to work ( it did not :( )

Aug 17 2016 -
	2.1 Got Gmail API working! woo! Can now get messages from email account (gmail_reader.rb)
	2.2 Sorted out only SEB automailer messages (gmail_reader.rb)
	2.3 Cleverfund now makes a difference between different types of mails (broneering, laekumine, v√§ljaminek)
	2.4 Created a notice class for holding information about the notice (Notice.rb)
	2.5 Created a parser for different types of messages (notice_parser.rb)
	2.6 Right now gmail_reader.rb reads all emails, sorts out sebautomailer ones and sends them to parser, parser
		then parses the mail accordingly and returns Notice Object to gmail_reader.rb

Aug 17 2016 -
	3.1 Removed Notice.rb from /lib because model class (app/models/notice.rb) already did all the work
		I needed it to do out of the box :O. Cool
	3.2 notice_parser.rb now creates notice model and saves it to database! Just like magic.
	3.3 Renamed files to use lowercase and _ (Coz its the Ruby way..)
	3.4 Created a view (index.html.erb) for the button to scan for new notices from Gmail API
		Thing works like this:
		3.4.1 /notice contains a button that goes to /notice/scan
		3.4.2 /notice/scan route refers to a scan method in NoticeController
		3.4.3 /scan method calls the gmail_reader.rb and the rest as they say is history
	3.5 Figured out how to view the stuff in database, rails console! Notice.all shows all the entries
		and Notice.delete_all well... deletes them :)
