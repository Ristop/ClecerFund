== CleverFund

CleverFund will be easy to use budgeting app that reads the data from bank notices that are sent to your email
account when you have that option enabled in your banks setting. It will use gmail API for ruby to fetch bank
messages and import the data to excel spreadsheet.

* App is in pre-alpha and is not yet usable!

Since this is my first rails application, I will be documenting all the changes very specifically in changelog.txt
